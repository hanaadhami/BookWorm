# Project Description
BookWorm App allows a user to search for a book of their liking and add it to "Read Later" library.  When they click on it a modal appears on screen that displays information about that book's most relevant NYTimes book review, if available, as well as a link to the full review on the NYTimes website. After exploring the review, the user has the option to 'save' the book to their library and add it to a stockpile of other saved books to keep track of future reading material.
