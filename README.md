# Project Description
BookWorm App allows a user to search for a book of their liking and add it to "Read Later" library. Once it's in their library they have the option to click on it to find out more information or delete it from their library. When they click on it a modul pops up that shows more details on the books, such as a desciption, book reviews, and a link to buy it.
